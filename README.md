# ETS2/ATS Tracker
Delivery tracker for Euro Truck Simulator 2/American Truck Simulator, based on [ETCARS plugin](https://etcars.jammerxd.com/)

## How it works
Tracker is based on Discord bot, from which you can retrieve basic info about deliveries and some statistics. 
EXE file must be running on background while playing game in order to communicate with database over another file, and save cancelled/finished delivery.
Delivery is saved in database file, plus sent via webkook on main Discord server.

## Main features
* Simple and easy to use
* Low resources consumption
* Accurate logging every time - thanks to plugin data
* Tracker is standalone file - no need to install anything

## How to use it?
1. Download latest release of EXE tracker - can be found on Discord server below
2. Download and install latest release of [ETCARS plugin](https://etcars.jammerxd.com/)
3. Launch tracker, follow the instructions for first logging in
4. Launch game, click "OK" on SDK features (before selecting profile)
5. Enjoy!


**NOTE:** This is only alpha version of tracker, therefore it can contain some bugs. 

This project has been also _temporarily_ terminated due to lots of problems and lack of free time for development.
